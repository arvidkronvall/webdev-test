# webdev-test

Welcome!

//UPDATES. Client.html are no longer served via the go web-server. Client.js is no longer of type "module". I didn't really know what "module" meant, but It was needed to serve the client.html - I suspect a few of the bugs came from this end. OBS. NEW INSTRUCTIONS!

#Cats Incorpurrate

Deploy:

The go web-server will always run on port :5600.

1. run server via "go run main.go". 

2. Run client.html locally. I ran it on http://localhost:5500/client.html. 
PS. refresh the page once. There's still an async bug that I don't know how to work around.

3. Enjoy the cats!
